The following photos were taken during my visit to Anacapa Island in the pacific coast of California during September 2011. Anacapa Island is part of Channel islands maintained by U.S National Park service. It was absolutely brilliant and vibrant place to visit. If you happen to visit as a group, I would strongly recommend a night stay in the camp sight. You need to make reservation for Ferry service and Camp site in advance. You can find more details about Anacapa Island [here](http://www.islandpackers.com/) and [here](http://www.nps.gov/chis/planyourvisit/anacapa.htm).
