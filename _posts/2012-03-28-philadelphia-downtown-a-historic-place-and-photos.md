I was in Philadelphia last summer for a month. It was a great to experience the heritage and dynamic life of Philadelphia Downtown, a Historic capital. Independence Hall, Philadelphia Museum, countless Irish pubs, Franklin Institute are worth mentioning which one should not miss to experience. Being one of the oldest city in America, the streets, Four squares and the buildings have a aesthetic look telling us the heritage and history they hold.

Philadelphia Downtown offers a lot for dining ranging from sidewalk cafes to premium dining places for occasions. You should try Reading Terminal Market which is one of the kind in America (Not in India. We have lots of places like that). If you are a sea food lover, McCormick & Schmick Seafood Restaurant is the one for you. I had an opportunity to dine in famous Del Friscoâ€™s Double Eagle Steak House whichI paid using the company credit card :P but the food and ambience was awesome.

If you are not sure what to do in an evening, you should give a try to The Schuylkill River Trail where you can spend the evening walking along the river.
